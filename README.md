# Recommendation-System-Based-On-User-Feedback

This repo implements a method for a recommender system that uses ABSA to analyze user feedback and recommend products to that user in a personalized way based on the analysis of the main product category and product subcategory. The system then extracts the features that the user mentioned in the feedback, then performs a search and ranking of products that are likely to be suitable for the user. The final result is a ranked product list.
